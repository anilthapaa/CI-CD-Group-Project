# ICA1-CICD
# 🌦️ Weather CLI App

## 🔍 Introduction

This project is a simple Node.js command-line application that fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on a given city name.

It is designed as a hands-on challenge for exploring **GitHub Actions** and **CI/CD practices**, with a focus on:

- Automating testing and deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions.
- Integrating with an external API securely using **GitHub Secrets**.
- Understanding best practices for managing environment variables and sensitive data.
- Practicing real-world Continuous Integration workflows in a Node.js environment.

> ⚠️ The OpenWeatherMap API key is required for the application to function and must be stored securely using environment variables or GitHub Secrets.
